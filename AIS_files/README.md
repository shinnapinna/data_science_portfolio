# Project Overview:

The data for the two notebooks in this folder looks at measurements of the Axon Initial Segment (AIS) length. Data collection was undertaken during my PhD and a represenations of raw images and measurement collection are show in the image below. Panels A' and B' panel show AIS traces measured from raw images A & B. All images were analysed using FIJI/ImageJ.

### Project 1:
  - [AIS Multiple models new](https://github.com/shinnapinna/data_science_portfolio/blob/05f3017545c6eb12bf6dc40768ebb0cf5ba4b7a0/AIS_files/AIS_Multiple_models_new.ipynb): Compares the effects of different genetic mutations implicated in autism spectrum disorder on the AIS length.

### Project 2:
  - [AIS_GLMM_new](https://github.com/shinnapinna/data_science_portfolio/blob/05f3017545c6eb12bf6dc40768ebb0cf5ba4b7a0/AIS_files/AIS_GLMM_new.ipynb) Runs a statistical comparison of the effect of the same genetic mutation across different brain regions in Python using StatsModels.
  - [LMM Syntax Final](https://github.com/shinnapinna/data_science_portfolio/blob/05f3017545c6eb12bf6dc40768ebb0cf5ba4b7a0/AIS_files/LMM_Syntax_final.sps): Is the SPSS Syntax used to run a Generlised Linear Mixed Effects Model, while the SPSS model output file can be viewed [here](https://github.com/shinnapinna/data_science_portfolio/blob/05f3017545c6eb12bf6dc40768ebb0cf5ba4b7a0/AIS_files/LMM_SPSS_Output.pdf).
