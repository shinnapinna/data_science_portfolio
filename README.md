# Data Science Portfolio
Repository of data science projects showcasing my ability to work with different data-types. All projects are presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

#### Note: 
Data used in the projects is for demonstration purposes only as some of it is awaiting publication. As such it has been anonymised and is unavailable for download.
