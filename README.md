# Data Science Portfolio
Repository of data science projects showcasing my ability to work with different data-types. All projects are presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

Note: Some of the data in these projects is anonymised as it is awaiting publication. Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.

### Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
- Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
- Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Anaconda etc.
