## Overview:
The Notebooks in this section all work on a data obtained from electrophysiological recordings of neurons. Different cells have different intrinsic biophysical 'firing' properties (see image below), and can be distinguished without the need for a genetic tag by a combination of these properties.

### Projects
In these projects I use a mixture of supervised machine learning classification approaches and unsupervised clustering to sort an unknown cell type into 'known' categories:
- [ML Classification of Ephys Data](https://github.com/shinnapinna/data_science_portfolio/blob/a9ce5daf12af119cd769f35dcf52b6bc6b0273d1/Ephys%20files/ML%20Classification%20of%20Ephys%20Data.ipynb): Uses a Logistic Regression classifier
- [ML Classification with PCA](https://github.com/shinnapinna/data_science_portfolio/blob/a9ce5daf12af119cd769f35dcf52b6bc6b0273d1/Ephys%20files/ML%20Classification%20with%20PCA.ipynb): Uses a Random Forest Classifier with Linear Dimensionality Reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- [ML Clustering](https://github.com/shinnapinna/data_science_portfolio/blob/a9ce5daf12af119cd769f35dcf52b6bc6b0273d1/Ephys%20files/ML%20Clustering.ipynb): Sorts the cells using K-means and Agglomerative clustering techniques
